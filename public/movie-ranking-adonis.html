<h1>The Best Movies According to Adonis</h1> 

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2> 

<hr /> 

<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>It's a violent movie, with a lot of good actors, directed by Tarantino and with a lot of spectacular dialogues and a lot of funny scenes.</p>
 
<h3>Duna</h3>
<p>One of the best distopic stories of all times and incredible actors that shows a story of a guy (Paul) and his journey to take back everything that was stolen from his family and people.</p>
 
<h3>Ex Machina</h3>
<p>Really cool sci-fi movie that makes us think about what makes us human and if machines can be like us.</p>
